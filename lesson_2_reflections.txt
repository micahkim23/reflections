What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is added and now you can use git commands on the file. There are initially 0 commits. You do it to carry out version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate stage before committing the working directory into the repository. It allows for time to make decisions before  actually committing the working directory.
